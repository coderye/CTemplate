This is the C project with unit tests.
See Check: http://check.sourceforge.net/

You need the following programs installed on your system:
  -- Autoconf 2.59
  -- Automake 1.9.6
  -- Libtool 1.5.22
  -- Check 0.9.9

Somewhat earlier versions of these programs might work.

Then, do as follows:

$ autoreconf --install (optional)
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

Don't do "make install" unless you want to install the 'path' example.

path.c and path.h are built as a library.  
src/main.c:main() is a client of libpath.la, just as tests/test_path.c:main() is a client of libpath.la
